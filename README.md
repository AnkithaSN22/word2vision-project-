# word2vision-project-
Designed and implemented a Python-based project demonstrating the transition from an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) to a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for efficient image generation from text input. The project highlights how CNNs outperform traditional ANNs in handling spatial data, leading to better image quality and feature extraction.
Here is a ready-to-edit README.md template for your "Word2Vision" Jupyter Notebook GitHub repository. It covers the project description, usage, requirements, and other essentials in popular open source format. Update details as needed for your project.

## Overview

Word2Vision is a Jupyter Notebook project for generating or analyzing images using text prompts, leveraging state-of-the-art diffusion models (e.g., Stable Diffusion 2.1). The notebook includes support for handling custom prompts, negative prompts, GPU acceleration using CUDA, and FP16 precision for efficient inference.

## Features

- Text-to-image generation with customizable prompts
- Negative prompt support to refine outputs
- GPU acceleration via CUDA (if available)
- Torch FP16/float16 model support for memory efficiency
- Uses pre-trained models such as "stabilityai/stable-diffusion-2-1"

## Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- Jupyter Notebook (or JupyterLab)
- PyTorch (with CUDA, optional for acceleration)
- diffusers, transformers, and associated dependencies
- matplotlib for image display
- torch and torchvision
- safetensors
- (Recommend) NVIDIA GPU & CUDA for best performance

Install requirements using pip:

'''bash
pip install torch torchvision diffusers transformers safetensors matplotlib


## Getting Started

## Example Usage

```python
pipe = DiffusionPipeline.from_pretrained("stabilityai/stable-diffusion-2-1", torch_dtype=torch.float16, use_safetensors=True, variant="fp16")
pipe.to("cuda")
image = pipe(prompt="A scenic mountain landscape", negative_prompt="no humans")
plt.imshow(image)
plt.axis("off")
plt.show()


## Models

Stable Diffusion 2-1 (default)
Option to modify and plug in other HuggingFace diffusion models
