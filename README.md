# word2vision-project-
Designed and implemented a Python-based project demonstrating the transition from an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) to a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for efficient image generation from text input. The project highlights how CNNs outperform traditional ANNs in handling spatial data, leading to better image quality and feature extraction.
